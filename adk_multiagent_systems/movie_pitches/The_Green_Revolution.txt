Logline:
A relentless American agronomist, driven by a singular vision, battles the specter of global starvation by unleashing a revolutionary new seed, igniting the "Green Revolution" that saves over a billion lives and reshapes the future of humanity.

Three-Act Plot Outline:

Act 1: The Seeds of Concern
*   Setup: Norman Borlaug, a brilliant and idealistic young plant scientist, is deeply troubled by the pervasive famines and food shortages plaguing the world. He recognizes the limitations of traditional agricultural methods and dreams of a breakthrough that could feed the growing global population. His early research is met with skepticism by some in the scientific establishment who believe the challenges are insurmountable.
*   Inciting Incident: Borlaug accepts a challenging assignment in Mexico, focusing on developing new wheat varieties. This pivotal moment marks the true beginning of his dedicated quest to revolutionize food production, putting him face-to-face with the immense practical hurdles of his ambitious vision.

Act 2: Cultivating the Revolution
*   Rising Action:
    *   In Mexico, Borlaug faces daunting environmental challenges and plant diseases. Through tireless experimentation, painstaking cross-breeding of thousands of wheat strains, and sheer persistence, he develops innovative semi-dwarf, high-yield, and disease-resistant wheat varieties.
    *   He doesn't just develop the seeds; he champions a holistic approach, demonstrating to skeptical farmers the importance of modern agricultural techniques, including proper fertilization and irrigation, through hands-on field work and persuasive advocacy.
    *   The initial successes in Mexico are undeniable, transforming the nation into a net exporter of wheat. This triumph catches the attention of international aid organizations and governments in famine-stricken countries like India and Pakistan.
    *   Borlaug and his team expand their efforts globally, encountering bureaucratic resistance, logistical nightmares, and cultural barriers. He pushes tirelessly, often working directly with farmers in the fields, to ensure the successful adoption of his methods.
*   Climax: A major global food crisis looms, particularly in India, threatening widespread famine. Borlaug's methods, despite their proven success, face renewed scrutiny and opposition from various factions. In a race against time, he must dramatically prove the overwhelming life-saving capability of the "Green Revolution" on a massive scale, leading to a monumental harvest that averts catastrophe and solidifies the global acceptance of his agricultural innovations.

Act 3: The Enduring Harvest
*   Falling Action:
    *   Borlaug receives international acclaim, culminating in the controversial but momentous Nobel Peace Prize in 1970, recognizing his unique contribution to global peace through food security. The film showcases the widespread positive impact of his work, with billions of lives saved and agricultural landscapes transformed across continents.
    *   Despite the accolades, Borlaug remains committed to the fight against hunger, continuing to advocate for responsible agricultural practices and extending his work to other regions, notably Africa, and mentoring future generations of agronomists.
    *   He reflects on the complexities and criticisms of the Green Revolution, acknowledging the challenges while steadfastly defending its profound positive impact.
*   Resolution: Norman Borlaug passes away, but his unparalleled legacy as "the father of the Green Revolution" endures. The world continues to benefit from his work, which averted mass starvation and provided a blueprint for food security, cementing his place as one of humanity's greatest benefactors and an enduring symbol of scientific innovation for the good of mankind.
